Project Description:
DogProtector is a 2D Twin Stick Shooter designed and coded by Laurent Klein for the first year and first term module Game Design and Development.
The game is created in Unity and uses free assets and Music created by a personal friend, Sacha Ewen.

Our lecturer started us off with a 2D Twink Stick Shooter, but challenged us to push the envelope in Design.
My answer for this was a non-violent theme which doesn't use guns, but dog barks. I also pushed the boundaries on the life system, as the player
does not lose any lives when getting hit but will be disabled to play. The player needs to protect 3 kitties and he loses once all kitties are kidnapped
off the screen. 

Challenges:
As this was the first time working in Unity and even the first time touching a game engine for me, getting the hang of working within this envrionment was
the first challenge to overcome. Every new system was new and had to be learned and understood to progress through this project. Starting from setting up 
scenes, working with sprites and animations, coding a game controller and input systems.

Lessons Learned:
Using Unity and C# to create a game.
Looking at problems and obstacles during development differently and solving them creatively.
Finding and using resources to help understand new concepts and learn to use them within my project.
Game Development is amazing.
